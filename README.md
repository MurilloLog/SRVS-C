## Overview
This repository presents a framework designed to streamline the deployment and configuration of colocated collaborative mixed reality (MR) experiences that bridge both augmented reality (mobile AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments. The solution employs a centralized client-server architecture, where a dedicated local server (PC) manages real-time data communication and synchronization across connected devices, enabling seamless interaction between AR and VR participants. This approach eliminates reliance on cloud anchor services or third-party platforms, which often impose restrictive limitations, while supporting both ARCore-compatible mobile devices and various VR headsets for truly cross-reality collaborative experiences.

Perfect for:
- Prototyping multi-user AR/VR experiences
- Collaborative projects
- AR education tools

## 🧩 Project Components

|    Folder    | Purpose | What You'll Find There |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| `SRVS-C/` | Contains the complete architecture and technical configuration for the local server, including all necessary components and operational processes | Server code, database setup |
| `API-AR/` | Includes the mobile application implementation that connects to and interacts with the server framework | Unity project, App setup |
| `API-VR/` | Includes the VR application implementation that connects to and interacts with the server framework | Unity project, VR setup |


## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Before You Begin
You'll need:

✔ **Computer**: Windows/Mac/Linux with:
  - Node.js v22.12.0 ([installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
  - MongoDB 8.0.4 ([Optional](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/))

✔ **Phone**: Android devices with:
  - ARCore support ([compatibility list](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices))
  - Developer mode enabled

✔ **VR Device**: VR device with a 6DoF controller (Oculus Rift recommended):
  - Meta Quest Developer Hub app installed on PC (for Quest devices)
 
✔ Refer to [SRVS-C.md](./SRVS-C/README.md), [API-AR.md](./API-AR/README.md) and [API-VR.md](./API-VR/README.md) for setup instructions.
<!--
### Step 1: Get the Code
1. **Clone the repository** (download the project):
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MurilloLog/SRVS-C.git
  ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**:
  ```bash
  cd SRVS-C
  ```

### Step 2: Launch the Server
1. **Open two terminal windows** and navigate both to the `Server/` folder:
  ```bash
  cd Server
  ```
2.  **In first terminal (Database-MongoDB)**
- Start MongoDB
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
   ✅ Successful confirmation

  Wait for the log message: [initandlisten] Waiting for connections.

3. **In the second Terminal (Application - Node.js)**
- Install dependencies (**first time only**):
```bash
npm install
```

- Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
✅ Successful confirmation

Look for the message: "Wating for connections..."

⚠️ **Important Notes**:

- Do not close either terminal window while using the application.

- Closing the first terminal (mongod) will shut down the database.

- Closing the second terminal (npm start) will stop the server.

- To stop the servers safely: Press Ctrl + C in each terminal to terminate processes gracefully.

## 🎨 Using the App
1. **Connect Devices**:
  - **Positioning**: Point all device cameras at the **same flat surface** (table/floor).
  - **Connection**:
     - Enter the server’s IP:PORT address manually (found in [SERVER.md](./Server/README.md)).
     - Tap "Join" to sync devices.
     - Wait for all players
  - **Verification**:
    - Check terminal logs for "Client [IP] connected" confirmation

2. **Start Drawing**:
  - Choose colors from the palette in your app
  - Draw in the air – your strokes appear when you finish - others will see your drawings
  - Walk around - drawings stay anchored to their physical location

🔍 System Verification

To confirm the system is operating correctly:

1. **Check the server terminal** (where you ran npm start).
2. Look for these **key log messages**:

  - ✅ "Connecting to MongoDB..."
  - ✅ "Successful connection..."
  - ✅ "Waiting for connections..." 

## ❓ Common Questions
**Q: Why do devices need to be close together?**

A: Devices need to be close to share the same AR space and use a common reference point from the starting position for accurate synchronization

**Q: Can I use iPhones?**

A: Currently Android-only (ARCore requirement), but iOS support could be added.

**Q: How many users can join simultaneously?**

A. The system supports theoretically unlimited connections, but practical performance depends on:
- The PC specifications (CPU/RAM)
- Network conditions (latency and stability)
- Drawing complexity (size/detail of shared AR content)-->
